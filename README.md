## Goal
To create a fully functioning browser-based game of your choice using vanilla JavaScript

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3 with animation
* JavaScript (ES6)
* Git
* GitHub
* Google Fonts

## Controls
Click the Start Button to start the game Use the left ( ⬅️ ), right ( ➡️ ), up ( ⬆️ ) and down ( ⬇️ ) arrow keys to move the Snake around the grid.

## Approach Taken and Timeline:

Day 1: The first day was spent project planning and trying to breakdown the plan into manageable chunks. I used Trello for the project planning and tried to add as much detail as possible. I divided the features into MVP and bonus features. I also became pseudo coding on the first day of the project.

Day 2-3: For MVP, I decided that the snake should be able to move around the grid and the food be eaten by the snake. I started by creating the basic grid structure using HTML and CSS then I wrote the functions for the keys in JavaScript. I started the snake movement function (just so the snake could appear on the grid). 

Day 4-6: I built out the snake movement function to ensure the snake moved around the grid once the start button was pressed. I also focused on the food function and ensuring the food would appear
in random positions around the grid when eaten.

Day 7-8: The last day and a half was spent on CSS and trying to get the game looking as attractive as possible as well as fixing bugs that appeared when I played the game on the browser.

Day 9: final css

## Featured Code
The two main parts of the game to get working were snake movement and food movement.

Snake movement:
I had to make sure that the snake was moving in all directions and ensuring the snake was not going off the grid.
This was set by ensuring there were limits on all edges of the grid.

Snake getting longer:
I had to make sure the snake was getting longer each time the food was being consumed.

Food Movement:
I had to ensure the food(apple) would appear in random boxes on the grid after it had been consumed by the snake.

## Bugs: 
Snake kept on disappearing from the grid. I fixed this by ensuring the grid was ‘secure’ at all the edges.

## Wins and Challenges: 
A big challenge for me was getting my snake to grow longer with each food it consumes.
A big win was my increased knowledge of JavaScript. I was able to test out using the new concepts I had been taught. The project was out of my comfort zone and I was quite happy with the result.

## Key Learnings

* JavaScript Fundamentals: This was my first big coding project, and since it was strong on logic - it helped me solidify basic JS concepts & array methods. 
* Knowing when to take a break: This project taught me that I should step away if I've been trying to solve something for too long and not making progress. The break can give you much-needed rest and you'll likely come back with a better idea on how to solve the problem.

## Future Content: 
If I had more time to work on the game I would improve the CSS as well as add additional functionality is to the game like speeding it up every time I am an Apple would get eaten as well as generally improving the user experience
I would also modify it so it could be played on all screens especially mobile phones.
